    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    
    - added non-blocking NodeJS transport and materialization roles
    
    - added NodeJS package: Task.JooseX.Namespace.Depended.NodeJS
      
    - If some class don't have the dependencies, than it becomes "ready" synchronously.
      Thus, if we have a concatenated file with the inter-dependended classes, which are
      sorted in the dependency order, it will be executed synchronously
    
    [API CHANGES]

    `materialize` method of Resource now also receives the url of the loaded resource as 2nd argument
